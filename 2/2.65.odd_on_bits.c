/*
Write code to implement the following functions:

Return 1 when x contains an odd number of 1s; 0 otherwise.
Assume w=32

int odd_ones(unsigned x);

Your function should follow the bit level integer coding rules on page 165,
except that you may assume that data type int has w = 32 bits.
Your code should contain a total of at most 12 arithmetic, bitwise and logical
operations.
